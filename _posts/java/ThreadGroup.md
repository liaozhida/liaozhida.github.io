ThreadGroup

/**
 * A thread group represents a set of threads. In addition, a thread
 * group can also include other thread groups. The thread groups form
 * a tree in which every thread group except the initial thread group
 * has a parent.
 * <p>
 * A thread is allowed to access information about its own thread
 * group, but not to access information about its thread group's
 * parent thread group or any other thread groups.
